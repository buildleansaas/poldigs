  "title": "S. Con. Res.&nbsp;12&nbsp;(ENR) - Whereas Special Agents Steve Willis, Robert J. Williams, Conway LeBleu and Todd McKeehan, of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, were killed by hostile gunfire in the performance of a heroic effort to disarm a hostile cult and to protect the lives of innocent persons, including children, living in its compound; Whereas these men, along with 15 other special agents who were wounded during this confrontation, were members of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms elite Special Response Teams, whose members are highly-trained and experienced in the execution of high-risk operations; Whereas such Special Response Teams have been deployed over 230 times in the past year with no injury to any agent, including during a highly- publicized siege involving a fugitive white supremacist and during the Los Angeles civil disturbances in 1992; Whereas 182 special agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have been killed in the line of duty since Prohibition; and Whereas the men and women of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms mourn the loss of their brother officers, but maintain discipline and a commitment to the protection of our citizens at the risk of their own lives on a daily basis: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That the sacrifice and dedication of the agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is a cornerstone of our system of justice and cause for both sorrow and pride.",
